**WIP**

Libraries for the [**ATP**rotocol](https://atproto.com/) in Clojure.

## Usage

Follow functions available in core to see what you can do atm:

```clojure
(resolve-handle "https://api.bsky.app" "retr0.id")
;;=>
;; {:data {:did "did:plc:did-here"},
;;  :headers
;;  { ... }

(get-post-thread "https://api.bsky.app"
                 "at://did:plc:did-here/app.bsky.feed.post/3karfx5vrvv23")
;;=>
;; {:author "retr0.id",
;;  :name "David Buchanan",
;;  :text
;;  "apparently it's cybersecurity awareness month. you are now aware..."}

(post "https://any-pds-service.com"
      "your-handle.any-pds-service.com"
      "your-password"
      "What a lovely day!")
;;=>
;; {:data
;;  {:uri
;;   "at://did:plc:your-did-here/app.bsky.feed.post/3khomp3o6pc2n",
;;   :cid
;;   "bafyreicvmz4xjqt7j7uzi7vpzhxsfkkdaoh3vvucs76usvtwoedtgpep6u"},
;;  :headers
;;  { .. }
```

## What's inside so far?

* core: Just few functions as examples (yet to be decided what will be here).
* api: This is the entry point for making requests. Basically you can create a(n):
  * `agent`: Which lets you make unauthenticated requests to a PDS service.
  * `session`: It requires an `agent` and lets you make authenticated requests like creating a post.
* xrpc: Creates the HTTP request (GET or POST).
* lexicon: Contains schemas and validates (partly) outgoing data from requests against them.
